# BankApp

This project is designed to showcase my grasp of SOLID Principles and file handling techniques in software development.

Description
The Bank Model application has been meticulously crafted to adhere to the SOLID principles, demonstrating my commitment to writing clean and maintainable code. Built as a console application, it simulates a fully functional bank, employing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to manage various bank operations. Additionally, I have integrated unit testing using a familiar testing framework to ensure code reliability.
